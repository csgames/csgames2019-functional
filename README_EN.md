# Functional Programming

  After hearing rumors saying that the almost lost art of Functional
Programming could help to manage their parallel universes, the Council
asked each team to send their most fervent functional programmers, and
wants them to find solutions to their problems.

  For decades, adepts have shared the secrets of this art under
various forms. For example, the LISP world has seen the rise of the
[Church of Emacs] *(The One True Editor)*.

  Prudent about the use of these great powers, the Council will only
trust programmers with the purest (and purely functional) hearts on
those serious questions. You will have to demonstrate your mastery of
FP by finding solutions to the problems below.

  Every problem of this competition has been written with a few unit
tests and property tests. You will be given points based on the code
submitted and the success of these tests.

  Each problem also has an archive containing the cabal project to
work on. *Please submit an archive containing the whole project with
your modifications.* You can launch the script `dist.sh` at the
project root to recreate the archive.
