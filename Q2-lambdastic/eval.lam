{-

The term omega diverges both in call-by-value and call-by-name
evaluation. Use this to find a term that diverges only in one of these
orders of evaluation.

To test your work, run the interpreter:

$ cabal new-run lambdastic -- base.lam eval.lam

... and evaluate your term with both strategies.

-}

-- Let's repeat the definition of the diverging term
omega = let w = \x -> $ x x in $ w w.

-- Find the term that diverges with one evaluation strategy that you
-- have implemented but not the other
diverges_in_one_order = -- undef. -- TODO implement this
  $ const id omega.
